Predicting Wine Quality using Physicochemical and Sensory Data

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the quality of vinho verde wine based on its physicochemical and sensory properties. The model will be trained on a publicly available dataset containing information about red and white wine variants (link to UCI Wine dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality).

Data Description:

The dataset consists of two parts, one for red wine and one for white wine. Each part contains samples with the following characteristics:

Physicochemical features: These features represent the measurable chemical and physical properties of the wine, such as alcohol content, pH, and volatile acidity.
Sensory characteristics: These features represent the taste and aroma of the wine, as perceived by human experts.
Quality: This is the target variable, which represents the overall quality of the wine. It is typically an ordered categorical variable (e.g., poor, good, excellent) or a continuous score (e.g., 0-10).
Challenges:

Ordered and Imbalanced Classes: The quality labels might be ordered (e.g., poor < good < excellent), and the distribution of these classes might be imbalanced with fewer high-quality wines. This can impact the performance of some machine learning models.
Feature Relevance: Not all physicochemical and sensory features might be equally relevant for predicting quality. Feature selection techniques can be employed to identify the most informative features.
Model Choice: Selecting the most appropriate machine learning model for this classification or regression task is crucial.
Objectives:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values and potential outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the distribution of features and their relationship with wine quality.
Feature Engineering: Explore feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features for quality prediction.
Model Development: Train and evaluate different machine learning models for predicting wine quality. This could involve both classification and regression approaches depending on the nature of the quality variable.
Model Selection: Choose the best performing model based on evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (for classification) or mean squared error (for regression).
Model Interpretation: Understand how the model makes predictions and potentially identify the most influential features for wine quality.
Success Criteria:

The success of this project will be measured by the following:

A well-performing machine learning model that can accurately predict wine quality based on the available data.
Identification of the most relevant physicochemical and sensory features for wine quality prediction.
A clear understanding of the model's limitations and potential areas for improvement.
This problem statement outlines the core aspects of the project and provides a roadmap for developing a machine learning model for wine quality prediction using the vinho verde dataset.
